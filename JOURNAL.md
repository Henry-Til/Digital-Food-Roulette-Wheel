## 10/20/2025 - Research, Part Collection and Sketching  


On my first day of this project I figured it would be best to do some researching and to gather all my parts. For this project I'm planning on making a prototype first using using two 16x2 lcd screens, an Arduino and some tactile switches because I already have those readily available. As referenced in the rough sketch below there will be Three buttons, two for scrolling up and down and one to select what ingredients you have, there's a chance I might need an SD card reader for the project too but I'm going to try to avoid using one for the prototype and use one for V2.![IMG_3188.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzc5NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--80cc01372ccbd14b40d2457dde8542059c79245f/IMG_3188.jpeg)
